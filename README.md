# Resource-Optimization
The paper talks about optimization of resources, it considers a hypothetical scenario of Monaco: located in western Europe. Monaco currently does not have an airport located in its premises. In the hypothetical scenario we wish to build a new airport in Monaco with the aim of introducing the minimum number of new flights in the existing flight-network of the world, thus optimizing resources in general. The primary objective of this paper is to come up with a solution which finds the minimum number of connections that must be made from ‘Monaco Airport’ such that any passenger boarding from ‘Monaco’ shall be able to reach all destinations in the already present mesh of airports. The paper considers three methods to come up with the solution: Brutal force solution, Kosaraju Algorithm and Tarjan's Algorithm. It explains why the Brutal force solution might not be the best choice to come up with a solution due to its exponential time complexity. It then compares the Kosaraju Algorithm and Tarjan's Algorithm which have linear time complexity and also uses the concept of strongly connected components to come up with the best possible solution that optimizes the resources. At the later stage, the paper shades light on the proposed problem solution with pseudocode as well as a computerized C++ code which implements the proposed solution and is accompanied by its results.
